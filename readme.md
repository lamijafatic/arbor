## Overview

Arbor is a command-line tool for managing Python dependencies.  
It allows users to define packages, resolve compatible versions, and install them into an isolated environment.

The main focus of the project is solving the dependency resolution problem in a structured way.

## Features

- CLI tool  
  Simple commands for usage: init, add, resolve, install  

- Dependency management  
  Users define packages and version constraints  

- Constraint handling  
  Supports version rules such as >=, <=, <, >, ==  

- Dependency graph  
  Packages and their relationships are modeled as a graph  

- Dependency resolution  
  Finds a set of versions that are compatible with each other  

- Lock file  
  Stores exact versions for reproducibility  

- Virtual environment  
  Creates an isolated Python environment  

- Real installation  
  Packages are actually installed using pip

## How It Works

1. The user adds dependencies with version constraints  
2. The system collects available versions for each package  
3. A dependency graph is built  
4. Invalid versions are filtered out  
5. A compatible set of versions is selected  
6. The result is written to a lock file  
7. Packages are installed into a virtual environment

## Dependency Resolution Logic

The dependency resolution problem is modeled using a formal mathematical approach based on hypergraphs.

In this model:

- Packages and their versions are represented as nodes  
- Dependencies are represented as relationships between sets of nodes (hyperedges)  
- Constraints define which combinations of versions are valid or invalid  

This allows the dependency system to be described as a set of logical conditions over package-version combinations.

The model is then transformed into a Boolean formulation, where:

- Each (package, version) pair is represented as a variable  
- Constraints are translated into logical expressions  
- Invalid combinations are explicitly forbidden  

This formulation is converted into a satisfiability problem, which allows the system to efficiently determine whether a valid set of versions exists.

In the implementation:

- The mathematical model is translated into code  
- Logical constraints are constructed programmatically  
- A SAT solver is used to compute a valid assignment of versions  

The solver efficiently explores the solution space and returns a combination of package versions that satisfies all constraints.

This approach avoids naive search and enables handling more complex dependency structures in a structured and scalable way.



## Current State

The system currently supports:

- adding dependencies  
- modeling dependency relationships  
- resolving compatible versions  
- generating a lock file  
- installing real packages  
- CLI usage

## Things to be Done

- Replace the static JSON repository with a dynamic system that retrieves versions  

- Automatically select the latest compatible versions  

- Compare this approach with traditional search algorithms (backtracking / DFS) and analyze performance  

- Evaluate how the graph-based approach reduces unnecessary combinations  

- Add more CLI commands   

- Improve automation and developer experience  

- Handle differences between package names and distribution names  

- Add support for Python version and platform constraints  

- Improve error handling and user feedback
